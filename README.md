### üìÇ Back-End

The back-end service is built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Fastify. It provides a RESTful API for managing shortened URLs, tracking analytics, and exporting data.

> Start with [Back-End README](./server/README.md). Ensure the API is working fine and then run the Front-end.

### üìÇ Front-End

The front-end is a React-based single-page application (SPA) built with Vite. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the URL shortening service.

> After setup and running the back-end, go to [Front-End README](./web/README.md).
